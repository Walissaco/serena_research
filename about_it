** Key Terms in the Dataset **

1. Periacetabular Osteotomy (PAO)
• 	A surgical procedure to correct hip dysplasia by reorienting the acetabulum (hip socket).
• 	Goal: improve joint mechanics, reduce pain, and delay/prevent the need for Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA).

2. Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA)
• 	Also called hip replacement.
• 	In this dataset, THA is the failure endpoint after PAO — meaning the hip eventually deteriorated enough to require replacement.

3. Tönnis Grading
• 	A radiographic scale (0–3) measuring osteoarthritis severity:
• 	0 = no signs of arthritis
• 	1 = mild changes
• 	2 = moderate changes
• 	3 = severe arthritis
• 	Studies often stratify outcomes by Tönnis grade, since higher grades predict higher risk of THA conversion.

4. Follow-up Duration
• 	Indicates how long patients were tracked after PAO.
• 	Reported as minimum, mean, median, and range.
• 	Longer follow-up = more reliable data on survivorship and THA conversion.

5. Conversion Time to THA
• 	How long after PAO patients required THA.
• 	Reported as range, mean, median, or interquartile range (IQR).
• 	Example: “7 years (IQR 4–10)” means most hips lasted 4–10 years before THA.

6. Age at Surgery
• 	Reported as mean, median, range, or standard deviation.
• 	Younger patients generally have better outcomes and lower THA conversion rates.

7. Sample Size (Amount of Hips)
• 	Number of hips included in each study.
• 	Larger studies (e.g., >1,000 hips) provide stronger evidence, while smaller cohorts give detailed but less generalizable insights.

** How the Data is Used **

• 	Comparing survivorship: Researchers look at how many hips survive without THA over 10, 20, or 30 years.
• 	Identifying risk factors: Age, Tönnis grade, and biomechanical issues (like impingement or stress) are linked to higher THA conversion.
• 	Evaluating surgical success: Low THA conversion rates and long survivorship suggest PAO is effective.
• 	Guiding patient selection: Helps surgeons decide which patients benefit most (younger, lower Tönnis grade).
• 	Benchmarking outcomes: Large registry studies (Sweden, US) set baseline expectations for PAO durability.
